# fixmyjs || jshint-autofix

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jshint/fixmyjs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jshint/fixmyjs)

Meant to automatically fix your lint errors in a non-destructive way.

For the nodejs package see https://github.com/goatslacker/node-fixmyjs

For the website see https://github.com/goatslacker/fixmyjs.com

## How to Install CLI

    npm install fixmyjs -g

## Website

http://fixmyjs.com allows you to use this tool on the web.

## Currently supports

* Missing semicolon. `var a = 1` -> `var a = 1;`

* Missing spaces. `white`

* Multiple definitions of a variable in scope.

* Statements written better in dot notation vs square bracket notation. `foo['hello']` -> `foo.hello`

* Mixed spaces/tabs

* Unnecessary semicolons `if (1) { };` -> `if (1) { }`

* Removes confusing trailing decimal points `4.` -> `4`

* Obj & Array literals instead of new Array | new Object `var arr = new Array();` -> `var arr = [];`

* Adds 0 to leading decimals `.2` -> `0.2`

* Adds parenthesis when invoking a constructor without them `var a = new Foo;` -> `var a = new Foo();`

* Removes `undefined` when assigning to variables

* Removes debugger statements

* Uses isNaN function rather than comparing to NaN `a === NaN` -> `isNaN(a)`

* Moves the invocation of a function within it's parenthesis `(function () { })()` -> `(function () { }())`

* Extra comma `var a = [1,,2];` -> `var a = [1,2];`
